## 👋 Hi, I'm Paweł

I'm a **Cloud Data Engineer** with hands-on experience in both **ETL and ELT architectures**, focused on **cloud data migration, data platforms, and automation** on AWS and Azure.

### 🔧 What I focus on
- **ETL & ELT data pipelines** (batch, orchestration)
- Cloud data platforms & migration (AWS, Azure)
- Legacy system modernization (SQL → Spark)
- Workflow & reporting automation

### 🧪 Selected projects
- **Airflow-Orchestrated ETL Pipeline** – REST API ingestion, transformation, validation
- **Invoice Data Processing Automation (OCR)** – document ingestion → structured data
- **Legacy Reporting Automation** – reducing manual effort in recurring reports

> Note: While demo projects focus on ETL patterns, my production work is primarily **ELT-oriented**, leveraging cloud-native storage and compute for scalable data processing.
